From Wikipedia:

\begin{quotation}
In mathematics, Hermite's identity, named after Charles Hermite, gives the value of a summation involving the floor function. It states that for every real number $x$ and for every positive integer $n$ the following identity holds:

$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}\floor{x+\frac{k}{n}}=\floor{ nx }
$$
\end{quotation}

Where does this come from?

Outline

We have $x = \floor{x} + \{x\}$, where $\{x\}$ is fractional part of $x$.

Picture a number line.

The interval $[ \floor{ x } , 1 + \floor{ x } )$ is mapped under multiplication by $n$ to $[ n \floor{ x } , n \floor{ x } + n )$.

There are $n$ integers in the interval 
$[ n \floor{ x } , n \floor{ x } + n )$, 
these are
$ n \floor{ x } , n \floor{ x } + 1, \ldots n \floor{ x } + n-1 $. 


These integers map to points in the small interval  $[ \, \floor{ x } , 1 + \floor{ x } \, )$ that are separated by a gap of $\frac{1}{n}$.

These points are at 

$$
\floor{x} , \floor{x} + \frac{1}{n}, \floor{x} + \frac{2}{n}, \ldots , \floor{x} + \frac{n-1}{n}
$$

The last of these points that is less than or equal to $x$ will correspond to $\floor{nx}$ in the larger interval.

Let $k$ be the integer with $0 \le k \le n-1$ such that

$$
\floor{x} + \frac{k}{n} \le x < \floor{x} + \frac{k+1}{n}
$$

So that $\floor{nx} = n \floor{x} + k$.


So we can write as a summation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\floor{nx} &= 
n \floor{x} + \sum_{j=0}^{k} 1 
\\
&=
\sum_{j=0}^{k} \floor{x} + 1 \; + \; 
\sum_{j=k+1}^{n-1} \floor{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

The points in the small interval on or to the left of $x$ can be shifted by one unit to the right, this means that the two summations above can be combined into a single summation in Hermite's identity.

$\floor{x + \frac{j}{n}}$ will contribute 
$\floor{x}$ for 
$0 \le j < n-k$. CHECK

It will contribute $\floor{x} + 1$ for 
$n-k \le j \le n-1$. 

Which provides the same value as the separate summations above.
